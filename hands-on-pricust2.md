## Prediction of functional diveristy using DADA2 output files and Picrust2

### Learning outcomes:

**During this hands-on session you will learn how to:**

Use DADA2 output to infer [EC](https://bitesizebio.com/10683/understand-ec-numbers-in-5-minutes-part-i-how-ec-numbers-work/) numbers and [KO](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html) predictions. 

MetaCyc pathway coverages and abundances will also be calculated and .tsv files with results will be exported.

**Notes:** Picrust2 and the plugin *q2 picrust2* has already been installed in your working station in order to follow this tutorial.
If you are following the tutorial on your own please find instructions for the installation [here](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-picrust2/13/)

This tutorial is ment to be followed after the QIIME2-sessions [hands-on](https://github.com/mbcarbonetto/qiime2-session/blob/master/Hands-on-V3.md)

- Every task that you will perfom is marked with &#x1F536;

- Questions to further analyse results will be marked with :question:
